# Compiler_Design_Lab

### Programs covered in Compiler Design Lab (CEN-693) during the course work of VI semester (2023)

**P1: _Construct DFA_** 
- WAP to implement a program that takes an input string from the console and verifies it against a Deterministic
Finite Automaton which is given through a separate file.

**P2: _Mealy Machine_**
- WAP to implement a MEALY MACHINE, where the program
generates an output corresponding to an input string given thru the
console.

**P3: _Moore Machine_**
- WAP to implement a MOORE MACHINE, where the program
generates an output corresponding to an input string given thru the
console.

**P4: _NFA to DFA_**
- WAP to implement the conversion of a NFA to a corresponding
DFA. The NFA must be given thru a separate file.

**P5: _First & Follow_**
- WAP to Evaluate the FIRST & FOLLOW information of a CFG
which is given through a file.

**P6: _LL(1) Parser_**
- WAP to Construct the LL(1) Parsing table for a CFG given through
a file. This program should call the FIRST-FOLLOW program to
generate the First & Follow information for the given CFG which
will be used to generate the LL(1) Table.

**P7: _LL(1) String Check_**
- WAP to implement LL(1) string checking process where a string,
given by the user thru the console, is checked against an LL1 table,
given thru a file.
